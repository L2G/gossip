<p><img alt="A Jabber Message" src="images/jabber.png" class=
"right" />Gossip is a Ruby library for sending messages to people
through various channels. It was originally written by Brian Marick
to help himself and another developer on a distributed project keep in
sync:</p>

<blockquote class="index"><p>The picture on the right shows the arrival of a <a
href="http://www.jabber.org/" title= "Jabber: Open Instant Messaging and a
Whole Lot More, Powered by XMPP"> Jabber</a> message alerting me to a checkin
by my codeveloper an ocean away. Below, there's a picture showing that our
deployment script adds a notification to our <a
href="http://trac.edgewall.org/" title="The Trac Project - Trac">Trac</a>
project timeline. Since the timeline has an RSS feed, at the beginning of the
day, I can easily see what happened in France while I was
sleeping.</p></blockquote>

<p>In addition to <strong>Trac</strong> and <strong>Jabber</strong>,
Gossip currently can talk to <a href="http://campfirenow.com/" title=
"Business chat for groups: Campfire"><strong>Campfire</strong></a>, a
<strong>mail</strong> server (SMTP), and <a href=
"http://twitter.com/" title=
"Twitter: What are you doing?"><strong>Twitter</strong></a>.</p>

<p><img alt="Trac" src="images/deployment.png" class="left" />Gossip
comes bundled with three utility scripts. One just <strong>relays
your message</strong> to all the destinations. Another sends out a
message about a <strong><a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/"
title="subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> commit</strong>. The
third watches a command run, then broadcasts <strong>command output
and how long it took</strong>. (This last is a derivative of the
"watchdog" program from Mr. Marick's <cite><a href=
"http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/bmsft/" title=
"Everyday Scripting with Ruby">Everyday Scripting with
Ruby</a></cite>.)</p>

<p>Gossip scripts are, out of the box, highly configurable. Each user
(real or virtual) can override defaults with configuration files
(YAML or XML), environment variables, or command-line arguments. (It
uses the <a href="http://user-choices.rubyforge.org/" title=
"Using User-Choices">user-choices</a> gem.) New scripts should be
relatively easy to write.</p>
