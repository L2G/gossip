Version 0.3.0
  * Version from _Everyday Scripting with Ruby_ renamed from Watchdog to 
    to Gossip and made into a Gem.
  * Generalized so that watchdog is only one example of the more general
    library.
  * Can now spread gossip to Campfire. (Idea taken from snitch.rubyforge.org, 	
	John Nunemaker.)
