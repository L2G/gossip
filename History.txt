Version 0.3.3 -- in progress
  * Promoted Rakefile additions to s4t-utils.

Version 0.3.2
  * The SMTP crony identified mail as coming from "[watchdog] ",
    which is not right now that there are other scripts. For the
    moment, I choose not to add something like a :mail_header_prefix
    choice - is there anything special about mail that makes such
    a thing appropriate there when something like twitter doesn't have
    it? Do I want to add it everywhere?

Version 0.3.1
  * Out of sync with name change in s4t-utils.
  * Squish warning message from xmpp4r.
  * Small updates to documentation.
  * More improvements to Rakefile

Version 0.3.0
  * Version from _Everyday Scripting with Ruby_ renamed from Watchdog to 
    to Gossip and made into a Gem.
  * Generalized so that watchdog is only one example of the more general
    library.
  * Can now spread gossip to Campfire. (Idea taken from snitch.rubyforge.org, 	
	John Nunemaker.)
  * Can now spread gossip to Trac.
  * Can now spread gossip to Twitter (credit again to John Nunemaker).
