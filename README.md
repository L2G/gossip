There are nicely-formatted [installation instructions](http://l2g.github.com/gossip/installation.html).

There is also a [description of the main classes](http://l2g.github.com/gossip/classes.html) to help you understand Gossip, plus instructions for [writing new scripts](http://l2g.github.com/gossip/writing-new-scripts.html).
