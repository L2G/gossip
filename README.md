[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/L2G/gossip.png)](http://travis-ci.org/L2G/gossip)

This is a fork of the original Gossip project, which lives on RubyForge. There is not yet any good reason to use this version over the original, as it is still being overhauled.

--------

Gossip is a library that provides a consistent interface to "cronies" like Twitter, Campfire, email, and Jabber. It comes with scripts that use that library to do useful things. There is a [more detailed description](http://l2g.github.com/gossip).

There are nicely-formatted [installation instructions](http://l2g.github.com/gossip/installation.html).

There is also a [description of the main classes](http://l2g.github.com/gossip/classes.html) to help you understand Gossip, plus instructions for [writing new scripts](http://l2g.github.com/gossip/writing-new-scripts.html).
